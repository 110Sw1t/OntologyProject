   Marketing   
Germain Lussier of   io9   spoke to the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing film  given the end of   Infinity War    which sees many established characters die  He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns  and if the actors portraying them would participate in press events leading up to the film  release  Lussier felt Disney and Marvel could focus on the original Avengers team members  who make up the majority of the living characters  but noted it would be more beneficial to show the return of the dead characters  which would  build a mystery and curiosity about   em how   they come back  It could create a whole new level of interest about the film while having all the stars front and center  as they should be   ref name  MarketingMay2018  /
