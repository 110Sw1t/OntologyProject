    Avengers Disassembled     is a   fictional crossover crossover   event involving   Avengers  comics  the Avengers      Fantastic Four      Captain America      Spider Man   and   Thor  Marvel Comics  Thor     Avengers Disassembled  saw the beginning of   Brian Michael Bendis    Avengers run with the destruction of the existing  traditional  roster and exile of several key members of the team  The other crossover stories intersect  or in the case of the Spectacular Spider Man and Thor crossover issues  or take place prior or after to the main Avengers story line  In particular  the tie ins saw other changes to the status quo  Iron Man once again closeting his secret identity  Spider Man developing organic webshooters  like the Sony Spider Man movies   and the death of Thor and Asgard in one final Ragnarok 

The main story   Chaos   ran in Avengers #500 503 and a special epilogue   Avengers Finale   and drew considerable controversy due to its overt continuity errors related to its main plot and deaths and vilification of classic Avengers members  These continuity errors and fan backlash would lead to retconning of the events in  Avengers  The Children  Crusade  and  AXIS   as well as the  Marquis of Death  story line from Mark Millar  Fantastic Four run and the Kurt Busiek and George Perez  Avengers/JLA  mini series and J  Michael Straczynski   Amazing Spider Man  run 

The series would also see to a massive relaunch of the Avengers family of titles with new ongoing series launched for the Thunderbolts  Captain America  and Iron Man as well as the launching of Young Avengers and Thor going on a three year hiatus

  Aftermath  
In the wake of  Avengers Disassembled   two new Avengers series were created  The     Avengers  comics #New Avengers New Avengers     title replaced the   Avengers   title  with a new No  1 in December 2004  which ended with issue No  503 and   Avengers Finale    November 2004   This new title continued with the creative team of writer   Brian Michael Bendis   and artist   David Finch  comics  David Finch    The other title  premiering February 2005  was     Young Avengers      which featured teenage heroes  each of whom  excepting   Hawkeye  Kate Bishop  Hawkeye    related in some way to the legacy of the Avengers  This series was written by   Allan Heinberg    a writer for     The OC      with art by   Jim Cheung    The group was revived by its creators in July 2010 with the bimonthly series     Avengers  The Children  Crusade     which is a follow up to   Disassembled   and     House of M     

The Scarlet Witch  storyline continued in the pages of     Excalibur  comics  Excalibur      where Magneto and   Professor X   tried helping her  to no avail  This in turn led into the     House of M     mini series and crossover  also written by Bendis 

The event is now considered by Marvel editors as the first part of a long series of events  which includes     House of M          Decimation  comics  Decimation          Planet Hulk          Civil War  comics  Civil War          Civil War  The Initiative The Initiative          X Men  Endangered Species Endangered Species          World War Hulk          X Men  Messiah Complex Messiah Complex          X Men  Divided We Stand Divided We Stand          Secret Invasion          X Men  Manifest Destiny Manifest Destiny          Dark Reign  comics  Dark Reign          Messiah War          Utopia  comics  Utopia          X Men  Nation X Nation X     and     Necrosha       All these grim events lead up to     Siege  comics  Siege     written by Brian Michael Bendis in 2010  which ushers in a new   Heroic Age  comics  Heroic Age   for Marvel  and     X Men  Second Coming     by Christopher Yost and Craig Kyle  which sees the slow rebirth of Earth    Mutant  Marvel Comics  Mutant   population 

As for the Avengers killed during   Disassembled   saga  they have all returned to life in separate events  Hawkeye was rematerialized by Wanda during the   House of M   story  Ant Man was rescued by the time traveling Young Avengers during   The Children  Crusade    as Stature brings him away from the range of Jack of Hearts  explosion  Ant Man is thus brought to the present along with the Young Avengers  The Vision is successfully rebuilt by Tony Stark after   Fear Itself  comics  Fear Itself    and Jack of Hearts is restored by a team of scientists of   Project Pegasus    during an assault of a pack of zombified clones of   Squadron Supreme    a source of zero point energy aggregates taking the corporeal form of Jack Hart

Although not bannered as a part of the crossover  the events of     Beta Ray Bill Stormbreaker  The Saga of Beta Ray Bill     are a direct sequel to the story in   Thor   

  Later references to the storyline  

     New Avengers Disassembled     
Although not directly connected with the previous storyline  Bendis  5th arc on   New Avengers   is titled  New Avengers  Disassembled   a reference to  Avengers  Disassembled   It deals with the events of the   Civil War  comics  Civil War    in which superheroes were forced to register with the government or be arrested  on the Avengers  and how the team  varying opinions have caused them to break apart  The first three issues featured Captain America  Jessica Drew and Luke Cage  opinions on the matter  all who have heavily weighed against the registration  The next two featured the Sentry and Iron Man  both of whom were for registration  New avengers 21 25

     Avengers  The Initiative Disassembled     
Like the 5th arc of Bendis    New Avengers    the storyline of     Avengers  The Initiative     also references   Avengers  Disassembled    complete with a banner reminiscent of the original  Issue No  21  the first in the     Dark Reign  comics  Dark Reign     event  centers on the aftermath of the failed   Secret Invasion Skrull invasion    and the revelation that the shape shifting aliens had infiltrated and corrupted the Fifty State Initiative and   Camp Hammond  comics  Camp Hammond    where the registered heroes were trained  Most disturbingly  Camp Hammond and the   Avengers  The Initiative Initiative   were largely under the supervision of the legendary Avenger   Henry Pym    but Pym had in fact been replaced by a Skrull years earlier  This is an opportunity for  top cop    Norman Osborn    the newly appointed director of   H A M M E R     formerly   S H I E L D     to radically redefine how the Initiative will fit into the new order—to his own advantage  Thus  the whole structure  and much of the cast  of   Avengers  The Initiative   is disassembled  Avengers the initiative 21 25

     Avengers/New Avengers  End Times     
Bendis  last Avengers and New Avengers storylines used a red smashed Avengers symbol and a black text box with white text in same font as the Disassembled logo on the front covers of each issue of thouse stories  Avengers 31 34 new avengers 31 34

     Ultimates Disassembled     
The 6th story arc of the 4th series of The Ultimate Comics series The Ultimates used the Disassembled name complete with the black box white text logo
