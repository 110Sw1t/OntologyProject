The degree to which Egyptians identify with each layer of Egypt  history in articulating a sense of collective identity can vary  Questions of identity came to fore in the 20th century as Egyptians sought to free themselves from British occupation  leading to the rise of ethno territorial secular Egyptian nationalism  also known as  Pharaonism    After Egyptians gained their independence from Great Britain  other forms of nationalism developed  including secular   Arab nationalism   as well as   Islamism   

 Pharaonism  rose to political prominence in the 1920s and 1930s during the British occupation  as Egypt developed separately from the   Arab world    A segment of the most Westernized upper class argued that Egypt was part of a   Mediterranean culture Mediterranean civilization    This ideology largely developed out of the country  lengthy pre Islamic pre Arab history  the relative isolation of the   Nile Valley   and the mostly homogeneous indigenous non Arab genetic ancestry/ethnicity of the inhabitants  ref name  Hinnesbusch  Hinnesbusch  p  93  /ref  regardless of current religious identity  One of Pharaonism  most notable advocates was   Taha Hussein   who remarked  Pharaonism is deeply rooted in the spirits of the Egyptians  It will remain so  and it must continue and become stronger  The Egyptian is Pharaonic before being Arab   ref   Taha Hussein     Kwakab el Sharq   August 12th 1933  إن الفرعونية متأصلة فى نفوس المصريين ، وستبقى كذلك بل يجب أن تبقى وتقوى ، والمصرى فرعونى قبل أن يكون عربياً ولا يطلب من مصر أن تتخلى عن فرعونيتها وإلا كان معنى ذلك   اهدمى يا مصر أبا الهول والأهرام، وانسى نفسك واتبعينا     لا تطلبوا من مصر أكثر مما تستطيع أن تعطى ، مصر لن تدخل فى وحدة عربية سواء كانت العاصمة القاهرة أم دمشق أم بغداد /ref 

Pharaonism became the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian anti colonial activists of the pre war and inter war periods  In 1931  following a visit to Egypt  Syrian Arab nationalist   Sati  al Husri   remarked that   Egyptians  did not possess an Arab nationalist sentiment; did not accept that Egypt was a part of the Arab lands  and would not acknowledge that the Egyptian people were part of the Arab nation   ref qtd in Dawisha  Adeed    Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century    Princeton University Press  2003  p  99 /ref  The later 1930s would become a formative period for Arab nationalism in Egypt  in large part due to efforts by Syrian  Palestinian and Lebanese intellectuals  ref Jankowski   Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism   p  246 /ref 

Arab Islamic political sentiment was fueled by the solidarity felt between Egyptians struggling for independence from Britain and those across the Arab world engaged in similar anti imperialist struggles  In particular  the growth of   Zionism   in neighboring Palestine was seen as a threat by many Egyptians and the cause of resistance there was adopted by rising Islamic movements such as the   Muslim Brotherhood   as well as the political leadership including   Faruq I King Faruq I   and Prime Minister   Mustafa el Nahhas    ref name  Hinnesbusch /  Nevertheless  a year after the establishment of the   Arab League League of Arab States   in 1945  to be headquartered in Cairo    University of Oxford Oxford University   historian H  S  Deighton was still writing 

  quote The Egyptians are not Arabs  and both they and the Arabs are aware of this fact  They are Arabic speaking  and they are  predominantly  Muslim   I ndeed  the Muslim  religion plays a greater part in their lives than it does in those either of the  Muslim  Syrians or the Iraqi  Muslims   But the Egyptian  during the first thirty years of the  twentieth  century  was not aware of any particular bond with the Arab East    Egypt sees in the Arab cause a worthy object of real and active sympathy and  at the same time  a great and proper opportunity for the exercise of leadership  as well as for the enjoyment of its fruits  But  Egypt   she is still Egyptian first and Arab only in consequence  and her main interests are still domestic  ref Deighton  H  S   The Arab Middle East and the Modern World   International Affairs  vol  xxii  no  4  October 1946   p  519  /ref

The   official language   of Egypt today is   Arabic language Arabic    The spoken vernacular is known as   Egyptian Arabic    while   Modern Standard Arabic   is reserved for more formal contexts as is the case in all Arab countries 

The recorded history of Egyptian Arabic as a separate dialect begins in   Ottoman Egypt   with a document by a 17th century author writing about the peculiarities of the speech of the Egyptian people  ref     transl ar Dafʻ al ʼiṣr ʻan kalām ʼahl Miṣr       The Removal of the Burden from the Language of the People of Egypt   by   transl ar   Yūsuf al Maġribi     /ref  This suggests that the language by then was spoken by the majority of Egyptians  It is represented in a body of   vernacular literature   comprising novels  plays and poetry published over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries    Classical Arabic   is also a significant cultural element in Egyptian culture  as Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature  and the forms they developed have been widely imitated 

While a huge majority of the Egyptian Arabic dialect is derived from the formal Arabic language  it has also been highly influenced by many other languages such as   French language French      Turkish language Turkish   and the old   Egyptian language    This is widely thought to be the effects of being the victim of several invasions  including that of the Ottoman Empire as well as the French invasion  As each nation came and went  the Egyptians kept the few words and phrases that made the language seem easier 

It is also noteworthy that the Egyptian dialect is the most understood version of the Arabic language amongst the   Arab world    This is because Egyptian movies have been the most influential in the Arabic movie industry and is therefore the most widespread  As a result  most Arabic countries have grown up listening to the dialect and therefore have no trouble understanding it  even though they actually speak their own

  Ancient Egypt   saw a succession of thirty   Dynasty dynasties   spanning three millennia  During this period  Egyptian culture underwent significant development in terms of   Egyptian mythology religion      Art of ancient Egypt arts      Egyptian language language   and customs 

Egypt fell under   Hyksos   rule in the Middle   Bronze Age    The native nobility managed to expel the conquerors by the   Late Bronze Age    thereby initiating the   New Kingdom of Egypt New Kingdom    During this period  the Egyptian civilization rose to the status of an empire under Pharaoh   Thutmose III   of the   Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt 18th dynasty    It remained a super regional power throughout the   Amarna Period   as well as during the   Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt 19th   and   Twentieth dynasty of Egypt 20th   dynasties  the Ramesside Period   lasting into the Early   Bronze Age   

The   Bronze Age collapse   that had afflicted the Mesopotamian empires reached Egypt with some delay  and it was only in the 11th century BC that the Empire declined  falling into the comparative obscurity of the   Third Intermediate Period of Egypt    The   Twenty fifth dynasty of Egypt 25th dynasty   of   Nubian people Nubian   rulers was again briefly replaced by native nobility in the 7th century BC  and in 525 BC  Egypt fell under   History of Persian Egypt Persian rule

Throughout the Pharaonic epoch  viz   from 2920 BC to 525 BC in   conventional Egyptian chronology       divine kingship   was the glue which held Egyptian society together  It was especially pronounced in the   Old Kingdom of Egypt Old Kingdom   and   Middle Kingdom of Egypt Middle Kingdom   and continued until the Roman conquest  The societal structure created by this system of government remained virtually unchanged up to modern times  ref Grimal  p  93 /ref

Another important continuity during this period is the Egyptian attitude toward foreigners—those they considered not fortunate enough to be part of the community of   rmṯ   or  the people   i e   Egyptians   This attitude was facilitated by the Egyptians  more frequent contact with other peoples during the New Kingdom  when Egypt expanded to an empire that also encompassed   Nubia   through   Jebel Barkal   and parts of the   Levant

The importance of the Nile in Egyptian life  ancient and modern  cannot be overemphasized  The rich alluvium carried by the Nile inundation were the basis of Egypt  formation as a society and a state  Regular inundations were a cause for celebration; low waters often meant famine and starvation  The ancient Egyptians personified the river flood as the god   Hapy   and dedicated a   Hymn to the Nile   to celebrate it    km t    the Black Land  was as   Herodotus   observed   the gift of the river

Egyptians under the   Ottoman Turks   from the 16th to the 18th centuries lived within a social hierarchy similar to that of the Mamluks  Arabs  Romans  Greeks and Persians before them  Native Egyptians applied the term   atrak    Turks  indiscriminately to the Ottomans and Mamluks  who were at the top of the social pyramid  while Egyptians  most of whom were farmers  were at the bottom  Frequent revolts by the Egyptian peasantry against the Ottoman Mamluk   Bey  s took place throughout the 18th century  particularly in Upper Egypt where the peasants at one point wrested control of the region and declared a separatist government  ref Vatikiotis  p  31 /ref 

The only segment of Egyptian society which appears to have retained a degree of power during this period were the Muslim    ulama   or religious scholars  who directed the religious and social affairs of the native Egyptian population and interceded on their behalf when dealing with the Turko Circassian elite  It is also believed that during the time of Ottoman period of Egypt  native Egyptians were allowed and required to join the army for the first time since the Roman period of Egypt  particularly Copts who were civil servants at the time of Mohammed Ali Pasha 

  quote From the Egyptian side  literary works from both the Mamluk and Ottoman eras indicate that literate Egyptians had not totally submerged their identity within Islam  but retained an awareness of Egypt  distinctiveness as a uniquely fertile region of the Muslim world  as a land of great historical antiquity and splendor    At least for some Egyptians   the land of Egypt       transl ar al diyar al misriyya      was an identifiable and emotionally meaningful entity within the larger Muslim polity of which it was now a province  ref Jankowski  p  60 /ref

Modern Egyptian history is generally believed to begin with the   Napoleon I of France#The Egyptian expedition of 1798–99 French expedition   in Egypt led by   Napoleon I of France Napoleon Bonaparte   in 1798  The   French people French   defeated a Mamluk Ottoman army at the   Battle of the Pyramids    and soon they were able to seize control of the country 

The French occupation was short lived  ending when   British Empire British   troops drove out the French in 1801  Its impact on the social and cultural fabric of Egyptian society  however  was tremendous  The Egyptians were deeply hostile to the French  whom they viewed as yet another foreign occupation to be resisted  At the same time  the French expedition introduced Egyptians to the ideals of the   French Revolution   which were to have a significant influence on their own self perception and realization of modern independence 

When Napoleon invited the Egyptian   ulama   to head a French supervised government in Egypt  for some  it awakened a sense of nationalism and a patriotic desire for national independence from the   Ottoman Turks Turks    In addition  the French introduced the printing press in Egypt and published its first newspaper  The monumental catalogue of Egypt  ecology  society and economy      Description de l Egypte  1809  Description de l Égypte      was written by scholars and scientists who accompanied the French army on their expedition 

The withdrawal of French forces from Egypt left a power vacuum that was filled after a period of political turmoil by   Muhammad Ali of Egypt Mohammed Ali    an Ottoman officer of   Albanians Albanian   ethnicity  He rallied support among the Egyptians until he was elected by the native Muslim   ulama   as governor of Egypt  Mohammed Ali is credited for having undertaken a massive campaign of public works  including irrigation projects  agricultural reforms and the cultivation of cash crops  notably   cotton      rice   and   sugarcane sugar cane     increased industrialization  and a new educational system—the results of which are felt to this day  ref name  Jankowskil  p  74  Jankowskil  p  74 /ref

A 2006   bioarchaeology bioarchaeological   study on the dental   morphology  biology  morphology   of   ancient Egyptians   by Prof  Joel Irish shows dental traits characteristic of indigenous North Africans and to a lesser extent   Southwest Asia  n and southern European populations  Among the samples included in the study is skeletal material from the   commons Fayum mummy portraits Hawara tombs of Fayum    which clustered very closely with the   Badarian   series of the   Predynastic Egypt predynastic   period  All the samples  particularly those of the Dynastic period  were significantly divergent from a neolithic West Saharan sample from Lower Nubia  Biological continuity was also found intact from the dynastic to the post pharaonic periods  According to Irish
