The novel is known for its high level historical accuracy of the life and culture of the period depicted  At the same time  it also carries a pessimistic message of the essential sameness of   human nature   throughout the ages 

  Summary  
The protagonist of the novel is the fictional character Sinuhe  the royal physician  who tells the story in exile after Akhenaten  fall and death  Apart from incidents in Egypt  the novel charts Sinuhe  travels in then Egyptian dominated Syria    Levant     in   Mitanni      Babylon      Minoan Crete    and among the   Hittites   

The main character of the novel is named after a character in an ancient Egyptian text commonly known as the     Story of Sinuhe      The original story dates to a time long before that of Akhenaten  texts are known from as early as the   Twelfth dynasty of Egypt 12th dynasty   

Supporting historical characters include the old Pharaoh   Amenhotep III   and his conniving favorite wife    Tiy  ; the wife of Akhenaten    Nefertiti  ; the listless young   Tutankhamun    King Tut   who succeeded as Pharaoh after Akhenaten  downfall; and the two common born successors who were  according to this author  integral parts of the rise and fall of the   Amarna   heresy of Akhenaten  the priest and later Pharaoh   Ay   and the warrior general and then finally Pharaoh    Horemheb    Though never appearing onstage  throughout the book the   History of the Hittites Hittite   King   Suppiluliuma I   appears as a brooding threatening figure of a completely ruthless conqueror and tyrannical ruler 
Other historical figures  the protagonist has direct dealings with  are    Aziru    ruler of   Amurru kingdom       Thutmose  sculptor       Burna Buriash II    Babylonian king   and  under a different name    Zannanza    son of Suppiluliuma I  Zannanza  bride is a collage of at least three historical figures  herself  first wife of Horemheb and  by him  mother of   Ramesses I    Historical Horemheb died childless 

   Plot   
Sinuhe recounts  in his elderly age at his location of forced exile by the   Red Sea   coast  the events of his life  His tone expresses cynicism  bitterness and disappointment  and he says he  writing down his story for therapeutic reasons alone and for something to do in the rugged and desolate desert landscape 

Sinuhe begins his life as a   Child abandonment foundling   and grows up in the poor part of   Thebes  Egypt Thebes    His adoptive father Senmut is a doctor  and Sinuhe decides to walk in his footsteps  Well educated  he sets up a clinic and acquires the sly and eloquent slave Kaptah  who will be his companion and close friend throughout his life  As an assistant to a royal doctor who knows his adoptive father  Sinuhe is allowed to visit the court and the young crown prince Akhenaten for the first time 

One day he gets acquainted with the gorgeous woman Nefernefernefer and is bewitched by her  Nefernefernefer gets Sinuhe to give her everything he owns and even to sell his adoptive parents  house and grave  When the woman has realised that Sinuhe has run out of possessions  she gets rid of him  Ashamed and dishonored  Sinuhe arranges for his adoptive parents to have a royal funeral  they had taken their lives before eviction   after which he decides to in the company of Kaptah go to exile to   Levant    which was under Egyptian rule at the time 

In Syria  he achieves fame and wealth because of his medical skill  One day  during an Egyptian military operation in Syria  he encounters childhood friend Horemheb  serving as a military commander  From this  Sinuhe is commissioned to travel at his expense in the known world to determine what military potential the established nations have 

Sinuhe  in company of Kaptah  travels first to Babylon where he engages in science and socializes with the city  scholars  One day he is summoned to the sick king  whom he manages to cure  In connection with this event  Sinuhe meets a young Cretan woman named Minea  recently acquired to the king  harem  Sinuhe falls in love with her and during a Babylonian feast he succeeds in smuggling Minea from the palace and fleeing with her and Kaptah to the neighboring country Mitanni  From there they proceed to   Anatolia   and to the fast growing Hittite empire  Sinuhe and his companions feel unhappy about the militarism and tough rule of law that characterize the kingdom of the Hittites  and they decide to leave Anatolia and sail to Crete  Minea  homeland 

Minea has grown up with the mission to sacrifice herself as a virgin to the local bull and sea god who lives in a mountain cave at the sea  Sinuhe is horrified by this and fears that he will not see Minea again  In the evening before Minea should enter the mountain cave  they marry each other unofficially  A while after Minea has been escorted into the mountain cave  Sinuhe enters the cave to search for Minea  He finds her dead body and realises that she has been killed by the god  high priest Minotaurus to prevent Minea from returning and revealing that Crete  god is dead  Sinuhe becomes out of his mind from grief  but Kaptah finally succeeds in calming him down and convinces him to realize that it  best to move on and return to Syria 

In Syria  Sinuhe returns to medical profession and he is able to regain his previous status  He notices  however  that the Egyptian sovereignty in the area has now begun to be questioned and threatened  This mood is triggered not in the least by the Syrian  Hittite friendly Prince Aziru  whom Sinuhe still befriends  among other things  through a medical assignment

One day Sinuhe decides to return to Egypt  He sails to Thebes and opens a clinic for the poor in the same neighborhood in which he grew up  He does not get rich in this  but instead is driven by ideological motives  His slave Kaptah  now released by Sinuhe  instead becomes a businessman and opens a pub called  Crocodile  tail   There Sinuhe meets a woman named Merit  who becomes Sinuhe  life partner 

In Egypt  a new king  Akhenaten  has begun to convey a monotheistic teaching centered around the sun god   Aten    According to Akhenaten  doctrine  all people are equal  and in the new world order there no longer would be slaves and masters  Aspects of Akhenaten prove to be unpopular  his pacifism  among Horemheb and others concerned with the threat of Hittite invasion; his attempts at redistributing property to the poor; and his worhsip of Aten at the exclusion of the old gods  among the clergy of the mighty state god Amon  Sinuhe is attracted to the teachings that the new king proclaims and  as he feels  focuses on light  equality and justice  and joins Akhenaten  court 

After a particularly violent public incident  Akhenaten  fed up with opposition  leaves Thebes with Sinuhe to middle Egypt where a new capital    Akhetaten    dedicated to Aten  is built  However  the conflicts between Amon and Aten continue  and it all develops into a civil war  Aten  kingdom on Earth begins to fall  and the courtiers  one after another  abandon Akhenaten and Akhetaten in favor of Amon and Thebes  It  also in Thebes where the final battle takes place  Sinuhe fights for the sake of Aten and Pharaoh to the end  but ultimately the side of Amon priesthood is victorious  During the chaos  Merit and her son Thot are killed   the latter would turn out to be Sinuhe  offspring  When defeat has become reality  Akhenaten dies after having drunk a cup of poison mixed by the embittered Sinuhe  Queen Nefertite  father  Ay  takes the throne  after the boy king   Tutankhamun    short reign  despite Sinuhe realising from Tiy that he himself is of royal blood and must be the son of Amenhotep III and his Mitannic consort  and thus closer to the throne 

Both before and after the fall of the Aten Empire  Horemheb conducts a war against the Hittite kingdom   Egypt  premier rival at this time  Both Sinuhe and Kaptah participate in this battle  as Sinuhe wanted to know what war is like  He succeeds with Horemheb  and Ay  mission to prevent the Hittite prince Shubattu from reaching Egypt and seizing the throne 

Sinuhe now goes back  afflicted by all the losses  to a simple dwelling in Thebes  bitter and disillusioned in the heart  Every now and then he is visited by his former servant Kaptah  who only becomes richer and richer  and is now Sinuhe  patron  Sinuhe begins to criticise the new regime led by his old friend Horemheb  and as a punishment for this he is exiled to the Red Sea coast 

  Writing process  
  File Mika Waltari 1939 jpg thumb   Mika Waltari    author of   The Egyptian    
Although Waltari employed some poetic license in combining the biographies of Sinuhe and Akhenaten  he was otherwise much concerned about the historical accuracy of his detailed description of ancient Egyptian life and carried out considerable research into the subject  By the end of the 30s  he had read such a vast amount of egyptological literature and familiarised himself with Egyptian art that he had no need to make any notes  ref name 1995doc/  The result has been praised not only by readers but also by   Egyptology Egyptologists    ref name seminar   cite web   url  http //www finemb org uk/public/default aspx?contentid 141670&nodeid 35864&contentlan 2&culture en GB   title  Seminar on Mika Waltari  novel Sinuhe  The Egyptian in London   last  Pöyhönen   first  Sofia   date  October 29  2008   website     publisher  Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland   access date  April 10  2017   quote      /ref  ref name 1995doc/  ref name HSmaailmalle/ 

Waltari had long been interested in Akhenaten and wrote a play about him which was published in 1936  In it  Waltari explored the disastrous consequences of the implementation of unconditional idealism in a society 

With the advent of   World War II    Waltari  idealism crumbled and was replaced with cynicism  it provided the final impulse for exploring the subject in a novel which  although depicting events that took place over 3 300 years ago  in fact reflects the contemporary feelings of disillusionment and   war weariness   and pessimistically illustrates how little the essence of humanity has changed since then  The political and battle depictions of ancient Egypt and surrounding nations contain many parallels with World War II  ref name 1995doc/  ref name seminar/  The threatening King Suppiluliuma has many of the overtones of   Hitler    ref Abe Brown  Hitler  fictional avatars   p  53 /ref 

In spring 1945 Waltari travelled to his mother in law  mansion in Hartola  where he began writing in the attic  The novel was written within a three and a half month period of great inspiration  with Waltari producing as many as between 15 and 27 sheets per day  So intense was his state of inspiration and immersion that  in a fictionalised account called     Neljä päivänlaskua     he would write later  he claimed to have been visited by visions of egyptians and to have simply transcribed the story as dictated by Sinuhe himself  His mother died during this; his wife managed the funeral arrangements  Waltari attended the funeral  and on the next morning he resumed writing where he left off  ref name 1995doc   cite AV media   people  Vuorenpää  Eeva  director    date  1995   title  Niin on ollut ja niin on aina oleva   trans title  So Has It Been and Will Always Be   medium  TV documentary   language  Finnish   url  https //areena yle fi/1 1467679   access date  17 April 2018   location  Finland   /ref 

The completed manuscript  totaling almost one thousand pages  was delivered by Waltari to WSOY in the first half of August 1945  Little to no corrections or deletions were required by the publisher   it went on to be printed as it was on the same month  ref name HSmaailmalle/ 

  Themes  
Central to the novel  themes is the conviction of the unchanging nature of mankind  exemplified by the reoccurring phrase  so there has ever been and ever will be   Waltari has gone on to state   Although the basic characteristics of a human being can not change due to the fact that they have 10000  100000  200000 years old inherited instincts as their basis  people  relationships can be altered and must be altered  so that the world can be saved from destruction   ref name 1995doc/ 

Idealistic and materialistic worldviews are at clash in the novel  the former represented by the pacifist pharaoh Akhenaten and latter by the cold bloodedly realist warlord Horemheb  This tension is played out in a world concerned chiefly with worldly matters and rampant with prejudiced attitudes and lust for material possessions  wealth and power  ref name 1995doc/ 

The portrayal of   atenism    as a doctrine advocating peace and equality  can be seen as an allegory of the attempted rise of an early form of   christianity     the description of Amon as  the God of fear and darkness who rules mankind because of their ignorance   whereas Aton  is the only god  for he lives in us  and there are no other gods outside  resembles the Christian   creed    ref name HS50v   cite newspaper  last Matilainen  first Jarmo  date 12 November 1995  title Kautta aikain neljänneksi ostetuin suomalainen romaani ilmestyi tasan 50 vuotta sitten   Sinuhen pitkä voitonmarssi  trans title   url https //www hs fi/kulttuuri/art 2000003484477 html  language Finnish  work Helsingin Sanomat  location   access date 7 May 2018  subscription yes    /ref 

  Reception  
The messages of the novel evoked a wide response in readers in the aftermath of the World War  and the book became an international bestseller    The Egyptian   has been translated into 40  fact date May 2018   languages 

French egyptologist Pierre Chaumell read   The Egyptian   in Finnish and  in a letter featured in a   Helsingin Sanomat   article in 13  8  1946  wrote of his impressions   I shall with utmost sincerity attest that I haven t read anything as remarkable in a long time  The book is indeed a work of art  its language and effects fit splendidly with the French language  it contains not a single tasteless nor crude spot nor archaeological error  Its word order  language  closely resembles the language of Egypt  and it would be a crime to translate it with less care than what it has been written with   ref name HSmaailmalle   cite news  last Rajala  first Panu  date 7 January 2006  title Sinuhe lähti maailmalle onnella ja yrityksellä  trans title   url https //www hs fi/kulttuuri/art 2000004365381 html  language Finnish  work Helsingin Sanomat  location   access date 6 May 2018  subscription yes    /ref

In Finnish literary circles  critics had generally regarded Waltari as an entertainment author  Despite its popularity and acclaim  the novel was denied a national award  Even the overseas success was denounced in Finland as an entertainment novel  success  Waltari finally gained appreciation in Finland in the 80s  after his historical novels had made appearances in French bestseller lists one after another  He is regarded in foreign countries not as a specifically Finnish author but as a master of   historical fiction   in   world literature    ref name 1995doc/
